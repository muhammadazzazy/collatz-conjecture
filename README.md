# Collatz Conjecture
This is a Python implementation for a program that finds the number of steps for a positive integer that is greater than one to reach one based on the Collatz conjecture.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#classic-algorithms).
